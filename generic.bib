  abstract   = {We present VOQC, the first fully verified optimizer for quantum circuits, written using the Coq proof assistant. Quantum circuits are expressed as programs in a simple, low-level language called SQIR, a simple quantum intermediate representation, which is deeply embedded in Coq. Optimizations and other transformations are expressed as Coq functions, which are proved correct with respect to a semantics of SQIR programs. SQIR uses a semantics of matrices of complex numbers, which is the standard for quantum computation, but treats matrices symbolically in order to reason about programs that use an arbitrary number of quantum bits. SQIR's careful design and our provided automation make it possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in VOQC, including full-circuit transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.},

  abstract  = {We formalise the constructive content of an essential feature of quantum mechanics: the interaction of complementary quantum observables, and information flow mediated by them. Using a general categorical formulation, we show that pairs of mutually unbiased quantum observables form bialgebra-like structures. We also provide an abstract account on the quantum data encoded in complex phases, and prove a normal form theorem for it. Together these enable us to describe all observables of finite dimensional Hilbert space quantum mechanics. The resulting equations suffice to perform computations with elementary quantum gates, translate between distinct quantum computational models, establish the equivalence of entangled quantum states, and simulate quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform. All these computations moreover happen within an intuitive diagrammatic calculus.},

abstract = {Quantum computing, once just a theoretical field, is quickly advancing as physical quantum technology increases in size, capability, and reliability. In order to fully harness the power of a general quantum computer or an application-specific device, compilers and tools must be developed that optimize specifications and map them to a realization on a specific architecture. In this work, a technique and prototype tool for synthesizing algorithms into a quantum computer is described and evaluated. Most recently reported methods produce technologically-independent reversible cascades comprised of a functionally complete set of operators with no regard to actual technologically-dependent cell libraries or constraints due to a device's pre-configured interconnectivity. In contrast, our prototype tool synthesizes algorithms into technologically-dependent specifications that consist of a set of primitives and connectivity constraints present in the computer architecture. The tool performs optimizations based on actual architectural constraints, and a high-quality technology-dependent synthesized result is achieved through the use of optimizing cost functions derived from real hardware and architecture parameters. Additionally, another important aspect of our tool is the incorporation of internal formal equivalence checking that ensures the initially specified algorithm is functionally equivalent to the optimized, technologically-mapped output. Experimental results are provided that target the IBM Q family of quantum computers.},
